## üí° Introduction

**Problem Statement**: Teachers in schools, coaching centres, and colleges often face a heavy workload when providing individualized feedback to students in large classrooms. Manual grading and feedback processes are time-consuming, leaving educators with limited time to focus on teaching and mentoring.

**Solution**: GradeVise is an Android app built to reduce the burden of manual grading for teachers and provide students with personalized, AI-driven feedback on their assignments. Through smart features like classroom creation, answer key uploads, and automated evaluation, the app enables educators to save time and focus more on teaching. Students, on the other hand, receive instant performance reports, progress-tracking visuals, and tailored learning resources like topic summaries, videos, and model papers‚Äîmaking exam prep smarter and more effective. GradeVise supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Quality Education and Reduced Inequalities, aiming to bring smart, scalable education solutions to classrooms of all sizes.
